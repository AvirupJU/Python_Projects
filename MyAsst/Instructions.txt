SHRUTI~YOUR CUSTOM PC ASSISTANT
===============================
This is a very basic PC assistant with basic functionalities. 
Please make sure all the dependencies are installed before running the code.
Packages such as webbrowser, os and smtplib are preinstalled. User must install pyttsx3(library for text to
speech conversion), SpeechRecognition(language processor), wikipedia(for handling wikipedia searches, do install it
to avoid unnecessary code for web scraping). User can modify the code and use beautifulsoup4 if they intend to fetch
results from other sites.

Users might encounter "Module error: No module named pyaudio".
Troubleshooting this issue is fairly simple: This occurs because sone PCs may not have Microsoft Visual Studio build tools
for audio processing (like Misaka). Install pipwin using "pip install pipwin". This contains the necessary modules 
for interacting with the ports. Then, type "pipwin install pyaudio". This should work. Make sure you have decent
internet speed otherwise it may result in a timeout error(as it happens with tensorflow installataion :3).

Also basic T2S codes using pyttsx3 throw a Module Error: No module named pythoncom. 
So do install pywin32 do negate it.

Feel free to customise it as per your needs. Python has a ton of libraries like selenium, facebook-sdk, tweepy, pyperclip, 
openpyxl to name a few. 
So yeah. That's pretty much it. Have fun!
