# Quarantine_Fun
Contains my mini python projects which I had been working on during this quarantine. 

A brief of what they are about:

1. MapIt- My very first project. It takes an address from the terminal and pastes it in Google Maps and shows you the location. Fairly straightforward, it uses webbrowser and pyperclip modules.

2. Scraper- A  basic web scraping tool using BeautifulSoup4. It takes all the data from the specified webpage and converts it into a "soup" object. Now one can extract all data
from the object.

3. Bernoulli - Simulating Bernoulli's trials using matplotlib and random.

4. Fiestel - Fiestel Ciphers are one of the most ingenuous encryption algorithms. A basic code to show how it works. The algorithm is two-way ie if you take the cipher text
and put it in the algorithm, it decrypts it (just reverse the key order).

5. MailBot- Using openpyxl and smtplib, I designed this basic bot that takes the email and names of people from an excel sheet and sends a custom mail to each one of them.
It's basically Mail Merge using python. (sorry...)

6. Hello - Integration, Fourier Transforms, solving differential equations and plotting pandemic spread using numpy, scipy and sympy.
